When I was 10 years old I remember driving with my mother from our old
brick farm house just outside of Coopersburg, Pennsylvania over South
Mountain to the biology department at Cedar Crest College, a small
women's college in Allentown. My mother was facilitating an evening
screening of a film about Jane Goodall's work with the chimapnzees at
the Gombe Stream National Park for her students who were in one of her
Zoology classes. The film made a big impression on me&mdash;I still
love nature documentaries&mdash;but I also felt the importance of Jane
Goodall and her work on my mother in the way she shared it with
me and her students.

It is natural for children to over-generalize from their early lived
experiences and family. My father was a Physics professor at Lehigh
University and my mother was Biology professor at Cedar Crest College,
so it took some time for me to realize that, not only do women not
make up 50% of scientists, but that it takes incredible fortitude and
dedication for a woman to earn a PhD in the sciences and make it as an
academic. I believe that the example of scientists like Jane Goodall
contributed to the strength my mother needed to pursue her passion for
nature and the environment in a male-dominated profession.

The way that Jane Goodall's influence worked through my mother to her
students and to me, and through us to others, shows me that a single
person has incredible power to change the world. When Goodall passed
away yesterday she was in her 90s on a speaking tour carrying her
message of a connectedness, conservation, and responsbility. What a
great example of hard work and singleness of purpose.

In addition to teaching and mentoring hundreds of students while a
professor at Cedar Crest College, my mother volunteered her time and
energy working with the Sierra Club of Pennsylvania advocating for
regulations and laws protecting clean water. She would read and review
legislation and drive back and forth to Harrisburg to testify at
hearings.  I learned from her that protecting our rivers and streams
is one of the most important ways to ensure a healthy environment for
our planet.

When I am discouraged about the direction of our country and our
planet I am going to try and use the examples of Jane Goodall and my
mother to remember how the voice of a single person can make a
difference and that individual actions can ripple like a wave through
generations of people who have yet to be born.
