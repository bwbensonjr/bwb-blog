In the mid-1990s we were living in Lunenburg, Massachusetts with a
growing family. My wife and I had family pianos as kids and we were
looking to purchase an inexpensive piano for all of us to use and
share.  We found a decent early 1900s upright piano for $100 in
Winchendon. We transported it back to our house in Lunenburg on a
utility trailer borrowed from my father and we got a couple of
neighbors to help lug it into the house.

While the green color had a lot of character, I saw the original wood
finish on the inside of the piano and I got the idea in my head to try
and refinish it by removing the paint and exposing the original wood
at some point. I didn't get around to it for 25 years, but after our
move to Watertown in late 2023 I decided to take on the task of
refinishing the piano.

I started by doing some research into painted piano refinishing
approaches and they were divided between sanding and stripping
approaches. The folks recommending stripping all liked an
environmentally friendly paint removing compound called
CitriStrip. Another common recommendation was to take as much of the
piano apart as possible to allow for much of the refinishing to take
place in a controlled, workshop atmosphere.

As I removed the pieces, I took some pictures to remnid me how I
should reassemble when the time came. This turned out to be very
useful towards the end of the project.

The inside of the piano has some really nice details. There are small
paintings of flowers and the manufacturing company is listed as
*Hughes & Son Piano Piano Manufacturing Company* based in Foxcroft,
Maine which seems to have been in operation from 1866 through 1921.

I started out doing a combination of sanding and stripping, but
eventually switched over to using CitriStrip as the first step for
everything. Removing all of the paint with an orbital sander was
difficult to control for depth, even for completely flat pieces. Depth
was pretty important given that most of the pieces had a relatively
thin laminate that needed to be preserved.

The CitriStrip process involved applying the pink goo liberally to the
surface, then covering with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out
quickly and leaving it overnight to do its job. The next day I scraped
off the resulting mix of stripper and broken down paint and varnish to
get the surface as clean as possible.  Depending on the success I
would either applied additonal stripper or did some sanding to remove
the undisolved spots.

Once the surface was sanded, I applied a Valspar wood stain with a the
color designation *Honey* with a rag, rubgging it in to get an even
hue. Once that was dry, I applied two or three fairly light layers of
water-based polyurethane.

I was really happy with how the final look came out. There was some
difference in color for parts that had different types of wood, but
the result is something that looks great with our house's stained
hardwood floors and, as usual, I learned a great deal about
refinishing and the details of our piano.
